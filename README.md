# Linear Regression on Study Hours and Scores

This project demonstrates how to apply a **Linear Regression** model to predict test scores based on the number of study hours. The steps include data loading, visualization, splitting the data into training and testing sets, training a model, and evaluating its performance.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:
1. Load a dataset containing study hours and test scores.
2. Visualize the relationship between study hours and test scores.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
5. Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
6. Plot the regression line to visualize the model's prediction.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab** for interactive execution
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `pandas` (for data manipulation)
  - `numpy` (for numerical operations)
  - `matplotlib` (for data visualization)
  - `scikit-learn` (for machine learning tasks)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
